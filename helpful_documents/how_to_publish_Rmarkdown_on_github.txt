Go to github
  Create new repository [don't need to initialize with the readme (can add later)]
    Go to R Studio
      File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git
        Ctrl+V  repository URL from GitHub
          File -> New -> R Markdown, enter Title, etc.
              In the Markdown window, change "output=html_document" to "output=github_document"
                Knit the document for the first time, will prompt you to save
                  Save as Title.rmd 
In the "git" tab of the R studio Environment window, you will notice that the knit produced:
Title.rproj
Title.rmd
Title.md
Changing output to github_document makes the original .rmd knit to .md so the code can be rendered when pushed to Git.
In the Git window, check the box to stage Title.md [NOT .rmd]
  Click "commit," add comment.
    Click the green arrow to push to GitHub.
      Go to GitHub, refresh the repository, and the markdown document with rendered code will be there

IF YOUR DOCUMENT INCLUDES GRAPHS:
When you knit, a new file will save to the Git window, called Title_files
When you commit, check the box to stage the _files in addition to the .md document.
This will commit the graphs as a separate file to the repository, 
although the graphics will automatically pull in to the markdown document when rendered.
